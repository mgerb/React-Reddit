# sreddit
This is a Reddit client that I am developing to learn both React and Redux.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a Reddit client that automatically updates posts and shows live animations.


## ToDo
Add options to side bar:

    - allow users to change color scheme
    
    - select amount of posts to load per page
    
    - add paging
    
    - quick view of posts and photos
    
    - live updating posts/comments
    
    - top bar to filter posts
    
    - localstorage - maybe look into localforage
    
    - styling for posts/comments
    
        - smooth scroll between comments
        
    - set up backend with Go
    
    - run on app engine
    
    - ...more to come

## Future
Future work includes incorporating the Reddit API, which will allow users to login and iteract with the site. For now, this is out of the scope of the project.
