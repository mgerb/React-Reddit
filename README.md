# sreddit
This is a Reddit client that I am developing to learn both React and Redux as well as ES6.

[Current development site located here](https://sreddit-mgerb42.c9users.io/) (may or may not be running)

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a Reddit client that automatically updates posts and shows live animations.


## ToDo

- comments page
	- load more comments
	- smooth scroll between leading comments
	- fix time stamps
	
- fix state on redditpost.js

- Add options to side bar

- ~~allow users to change color scheme~~
	- store in browser

- select amount of posts to load per page

- add word cloud to comments page

- ~~add paging~~

- quick view of posts and photos

- live updating posts/comments

- top bar to filter posts

- localstorage - maybe look into localforage

- styling for posts/comments

    - smooth scroll between comments
    
- get rid of jquery (use bootstrap without jquery)

- move all css imports within js

- configure webpack for html generation
    
- set up backend with Go

- run on app engine

- ...more to come

## Future
Future work includes incorporating the Reddit API, which will allow users to login and iteract with the site. For now, this is out of the scope of the project.
